# Frontier-Mathematics-Symposium
During 2022-2023 semester, with the opportunity of discussion class, under the guidance and help of Prof. Nansong Zhang, I mainly studied some of the more classical machine learning algorithms and optimization algorithms. These include decision tree algorithm, SVM algorithm, EM algorithm, Lasso algorithm, CMA-ES algorithm, and the newer reinforcement learning algorithm, DDPG algorithm.  In the process of learning the algorithm, I referred to relevant materials and prepared a handout, hoping that this handout can help more students who are learning machine learning algorithms.

This course is one of the most rewarding courses in my undergraduate career for the following reasons: first, I took the opportunity of the course to read a lot of cutting-edge literature, and gradually started from being a scientific novice; second, the course taught me how to make rigorous theoretical knowledge understandable in a pedagogical way and how to present it; third, through learning algorithms several times, I summarized some skills of self-learning new algorithms, how to learn an algorithm from scratch, how to read pseudo-code, how to find demo resources, and so on. I believe that these skills will be a great help for my research career afterwards.

As the Analects says, "Teaching grows with teaching". I am very grateful for the teaching opportunities provided to each of us in this semester's discussion class. In fact, through this semester's hone, I have become more aware that I can only be considered to have fully mastered my knowledge if I have delivered it in its entirety and made it available to the listeners as well. In the process of reviewing and refining knowledge, there are many confusions that arise and occasional inspirations that pop up, pulling back the threads and taking one step at a time, which is the process of learning. The teaching style of this course is very suitable for undergraduate students who are going to further their studies. This undergraduate course gives us a good platform to showcase and exposure to the academic frontier.

The repository includes the following documents:

- PDF document of the lecture notes;
- The LaTeX source file of the lecture notes;
- The code of the algorithm used in the lecture.

From the late summer of September to the cold winter of January, this semester's Frontier Mathematics Symposium course has gone on a wonderful journey. First of all, I would like to thank Prof. Nansong Zhang for his patient guidance and for leading us to appreciate the beauty of mathematics, and the seven mathematics school students who attended the class together, we made progress together, and thank you for your tolerance and support!
